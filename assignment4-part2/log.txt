Tasks: Quickly realized that I could not use XAMPP, which I had been using to use my computer as a local server to access OSU's MySQL database, so I figured out how to set up my personal site and get initial access to the database. Can now submit a new video via GET, delete all videos with POST. No data validation yet.

Tasks: Added check-in/out button and delete buttons for all table items. Still no data validation.
